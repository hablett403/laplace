# laplace

This directory contains Python functions to solve both the scalar and vector form of the Laplace equation under Dirichlet boundary conditions (and to a more limited extent, the Poisson equation) in Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordiante systems using finite differences. The PDF file contains the derivation of each of the equations.
